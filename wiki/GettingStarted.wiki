#summary How to start developing WebRL

== Getting Write Access ==

Write access to the source base is given very liberally - simply ask one of the project owners & you will probably get it.


== Getting the source ==

Look at the [http://code.google.com/p/webrl/source/checkout Source] tab on instructions regarding checkout from the Subversion repository.

== Developing ==

You can use your favorite editor or IDE to develop WebRL - it is only JavaScript, HTML & CSS.  However, a lot of us use Aptana.

=== Step by step guide to developing WebRL in Aptana ===

 # Download [http://www.aptana.org/studio/download Aptana Studio] (Don't forget to choose the jQuery JavaScript/AJAX plugin when prompted for extra plugins to install).
 # Start Aptana and choose File->Import.
 # SVN->checkout project from SVN.
 # URL is https://webrl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ (or with http if you don't have write access - just ask and you will be give one).
 # Username and password can be seen here (need to be logged into Google Code): http://code.google.com/p/webrl/source/checkout.
 # Choose the WebRL folder.
 # Start coding! [http://code.google.com/p/webrl/source/browse/trunk/WebRL/index.html index.html] is the natural place to look at first.
